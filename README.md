#### üë©‚Äçüç≥ About Us:
We are 4 international students/immigrants who:
1. Cook most meals ourselves, struggling to find the right taste and face health concerns.
2. Struggle to make even the most basic recipes.
3. Just 1 of us learned a new recipe in the past 6 months.
4. Obviously need help in the kitchen!
5. Face food insecurity (a challenge for every immigrant!).

CookWithMe was designed to make cooking accessible, engaging, and gamified. We allow users to follow recipes hands-free using voice commands via **tedAI** (we named it!). This lets users follow the steps without having to touch or scroll through the screen.

#### Features:
- **Hands-free cooking** experience.
- No intimidation of complicated recipes.
- *"No water, No problem!"* ‚Äì No ingredient? No need to rush to get it!
- Support throughout the cooking journey.
- Users can listen to instructions through headphones or a speaker, boosting confidence in the kitchen.
- An engaging, interactive cooking experience (It‚Äôs like talking to your mom on how to boil an egg!).

#### Tech Stack:
- React
- Python
- Flask
- OpenAI
- Axios
- REST
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon S3
- GPT-4o-mini
- Web Speech API

#### Challenges Faced:
- Streaming for multiple users.
- Using React for the first time and writing 3k+ lines of code.
- Linking EC2 with the S3 instance.
- Formatting a smart query to generate personalized results.
- Integrating DALL-E for generating images.

#### What's Next:
- Isolating user instances.
- Increase functionality available on our UI.
- (Final Goal) Transition into a portable and powerful mobile application that hosts the llm and processing locally on the user's own device.
