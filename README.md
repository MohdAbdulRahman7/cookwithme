#### 👩‍🍳 About Us:
We are 4 international students/immigrants who:
1. Cook most meals ourselves, struggling to find the right taste and face health concerns.
2. Struggle to make even the most basic recipes.
3. Just 1 of us learned a new recipe in the past 6 months.
4. Obviously need help in the kitchen!
5. Face food insecurity (a challenge for every immigrant!).
